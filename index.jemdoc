== About Me 

I am a Ph.D. student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [https://hexiangnan.github.io/ Xiangnan He] and [https://fulifeng.github.io/ Fuli Feng]. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering from USTC.

My research primarily focuses on the application of active learning across various fundamental machine learning tasks, aiming to explore efficient methods for selecting high-quality samples and achieving stable and sample-efficient model training. Specifically, my research interests encompass supervised learning, unsupervised clustering, virtual screening, and post-training of large language models. In these areas, I particularly emphasize the efficient generalization capabilities of models within the active learning framework and am dedicated to enhancing model performance in complex scenarios. If you share common interests and would like to explore collaboration or simply have a discussion, feel free to contact me.
